3. Quit and reopen vim.

## Solarized color scheme

Solarized is ugly and unusable with default terminal app color settings. To make solarized look right in iTerm, download [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/altercation/solarized/master/iterm2-colors-solarized/Solarized%20Dark.itermcolors) and import it in iTerm in preferences > profile > colors > load presets. Similar process for Terminal, but use [this file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tomislav/osx-terminal.app-colors-solarized/master/Solarized%20Dark.terminal).

To turn on solarized in vim, use `:colors solarized`. I'm also trying out using the desert colorscheme with the solarized imported iTerm colors.
